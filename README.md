# PyTorch TinyVGG for MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of TinyVGG model trained to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

### Overview
TinyVGG is a simplified version of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) neural network architecture, designed to be lightweight and suitable for small-scale datasets like MNIST. This model architecture consists of a series of convolutional and max-pooling layers followed by fully connected layers, ending with a softmax layer for digit classification.

### Pre-trained Model
You can download the pre-trained TinyVGG model weights from this repository.
